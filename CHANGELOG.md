# Changelog

Per-release notes for consumer-visible changes. `package.json#version` is
the single source of truth — see `docs/VERSIONING.md` for the bump policy.

## [Unreleased]

- TOG-5840: `openapi.json` `info.version` is now wired to
  `package.json#version` (via `src/lib/version.ts`) instead of a hardcoded
  `1.0.0`, so consumers can tell releases apart. Added
  `docs/VERSIONING.md` (bump policy) and this changelog.
