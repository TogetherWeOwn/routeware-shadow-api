# Changelog

Per-release notes for consumer-visible changes. `package.json#version` is
the single source of truth — see `docs/VERSIONING.md` for the bump policy.

## [Unreleased]

- TOG-7577: Client-facing retry passthroughs replace upstream HTTP 400–599
  bodies, headers and status text with fixed `upstream-error` problem+json,
  preserving the HTTP status and containing possible customer/session data.
  Successful responses, login retry and internal data-save envelopes are unchanged.

- TOG-9232: Readiness D1/R2 and advisory cron observations use a 20-second
  in-memory cache per Worker isolate; concurrent probes share two D1 queries.
  Authentication, report configuration, and the 200/503 payload are unchanged.

- TOG-5814: `GET /api/v1/data-snapshot/orphans` orphan reconciliation report —
  defensive audit for legacy or out-of-band rows, not normal streamed syncs:
  D1 enforces the snapshot FK chain on writes and parent deletes. Returns
  `orphanAddresses` (address rows with no customer) and `orphanContainers`
  (container rows with no pickup address), each as a count plus ordered id
  sample from one read-only transaction (`sampleLimit` 1–500; invalid values
  return 400 `application/problem+json`). Snapshot-secret auth, read-only.
- TOG-6537: HTTP login fails fast with 503 `misconfigured` when the runtime
  lacks `Headers.getSetCookie`, instead of silently collecting an empty cookie
  jar (which flipped `auto` mode to Browser Rendering or hard-outaged `http`
  mode).
- TOG-8877: `GET /api/v1/customer-snapshot/changes` incremental-sync feed —
  rows with `synced_at > since` in `(synced_at, customer_id)` keyset order. A
  bare `since` replays every later run whole; chunked deltas page with the
  composite `since` + `since_id` cursor pair (served by the
  `idx_customer_snapshot_synced_at` index), so same-timestamp rows past a page
  boundary are never skipped.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-27

Initial release of the Routeware Shadow API (Cloudflare Worker): shadow
health, Routeware account/customer/report proxies, customer/address/container
snapshots with sync and import, data-entity reads and writes, and the
versioned OpenAPI document at `GET /openapi.json`.

- TOG-5840: `openapi.json` `info.version` is now wired to
  `package.json#version` (via `src/lib/version.ts`) instead of a hardcoded
  `1.0.0`, so consumers can tell releases apart. Added
  `docs/VERSIONING.md` (bump policy) and this changelog.
